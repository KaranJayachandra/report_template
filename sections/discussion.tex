The examination of the BAC shows that the channel describes the most general case of all other channels. When we look at the diagonal of figure \ref{fig:allpq2d} we observe the characteristics of the BSC. When we look at any of the side of the graph, we observe the Z Channel. All other channels are a subset of the Binary Asymmetric Channel. Due to it's asymmetry the BAC can be used to transmit albeit at lower levels of confidence at most values of $p$ and $q$ with the exception being the case when both of them have a probability of $0.5$. This makes the channel completely random and the capacity drops to zero. In all other cases the BAC has some capacity and can transfer information at varying rates. The Channel Capacity is an accurate measure of the ability of a channel to relay information accurately. From section \ref{derive}, the capacity has been derived for the most general of cases which can be modified and re-purposed for many other channels. The capacity of the BAC has two peaks when the transition probabilities are either $0$ or $1$ and it's capacity goes close to zero when either of them is around $0.5$. A high entropy for the source provides a lot of information, but in the case of channels, the more deterministic channels (not when both cases provide the same output) have higher capacities. This is because they have higher reliability in transferring what was sent at the input and hence the output has almost full Mutual Information.
